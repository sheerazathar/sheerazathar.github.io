## Outreach and Broadening Participation

Broadening participation in engineering is a central component of my academic mission. I view outreach not as an isolated activity, but as an extension of teaching and mentorship—one that helps students from diverse backgrounds gain early exposure to engineering, robotics, and intelligent systems.

## Purdue University Programs

### Minority Engineering Program (MEP)
I have actively participated in Purdue’s Minority Engineering Program, mentoring undergraduate students through academic support, professional development, and exposure to research opportunities.

### PREFACE (Pre-Freshman Engineering Program)
Through Purdue’s PREFACE initiative, I engaged with incoming engineering students during their transition into the university.
