## Outreach and Broadening Participation

Broadening participation in engineering is a central component of my academic mission. I view outreach not as an isolated activity, but as an extension of teaching and mentorship—one that helps students from diverse backgrounds gain early exposure to engineering, robotics, and intelligent systems. Through sustained engagement at the K–12, pre-college, and undergraduate levels, I aim to create inclusive pathways into engineering education and research.

## Purdue University Programs

### [June 2025] Blue Sky Summer Scholars Program (BSS)

MARS Lab collaborated with the Blue Sky Summer Scholars Program and hosted an interactive lab tour session for Ivy Tech Community College students, including robot demonstrations, perception-based manipulation examples, and discussions on pathways into engineering and research.

### [July 2025] MITE Summer Program

Through Purdue’s MITE (Multiethnic Introduction to Engineering) program, I supported pre-college students through interactive robotics demonstrations and mentoring. I focused on helping students connect foundational math/physics ideas to real robotic systems and encouraged confidence-building through hands-on exploration.

### [June 2025] PREFACE Summer Program

Through Purdue’s PREFACE initiative, I engaged with incoming engineering students during their transition into the university. My involvement focused on mentoring, academic preparedness, and introducing students to hands-on engineering concepts, particularly in robotics and intelligent systems.

### [June 2024] PREFACE Summer Program

I also supported PREFACE programming in 2024, helping new students build confidence through guided lab tours and interactive demonstrations. My goal was to make research environments approachable and to encourage students—especially those from underrepresented or first-generation backgrounds—to see themselves as future engineers and researchers.

### [Sep 2025] Purdue FIRST Robotics

I have supported outreach through FIRST Robotics, introducing students to robotics demonstrations and emphasizing how mechanical design, sensing, and programming work together in real systems. These interactions help students build early confidence and curiosity, especially for students who may not otherwise have direct exposure to engineering labs.

## Commitment to Mentorship and Inclusive Pathways

Across these activities, I prioritize mentorship and inclusive engagement. I aim to make engineering approachable through simple demonstrations, open Q&A, and honest discussion of educational pathways. I also emphasize that uncertainty and iteration are integral parts of engineering practice. Through these outreach efforts, I hope to strengthen pipelines into robotics and intelligent systems for students from diverse and historically underrepresented backgrounds.
