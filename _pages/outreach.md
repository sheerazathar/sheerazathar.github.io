## Outreach and Broadening Participation

Broadening participation in engineering is a central component of my academic mission. I view outreach not as an isolated activity, but as an extension of teaching and mentorship—one that helps students from diverse backgrounds gain early exposure to engineering, robotics, and intelligent systems. Through sustained engagement at the K–12, pre-college, and undergraduate levels, I aim to create inclusive pathways into engineering education and research.

## Purdue University Programs

### Minority Engineering Program (MEP)
I have actively participated in Purdue’s Minority Engineering Program, mentoring undergraduate students through academic support, professional development, and exposure to research opportunities. Through MEP, I have worked closely with students from historically underrepresented and first-generation backgrounds, helping them navigate coursework, explore research directions, and build confidence in their engineering identity.

### PREFACE (Pre-Freshman Engineering Program)
Through Purdue’s PREFACE initiative, I engaged with incoming engineering students during their transition into the university. My involvement focused on mentoring, academic preparedness, and introducing students to hands-on engineering concepts, particularly in robotics and automation. These early interventions play a critical role in student retention and long-term success.

## K–12 and Pre-College Outreach

### FIRST Robotics
I have supported outreach activities connected to FIRST Robotics, mentoring students and teams engaged in robotics-based learning. These experiences emphasize teamwork, problem-solving, and real-world engineering design, while also helping students develop early interest in STEM fields.

## Research-Driven Outreach

My outreach efforts are closely integrated with my research and teaching. I regularly involve undergraduate students in hands-on research projects related to robotics, sensing, and intelligent systems, providing early exposure to research methodologies and experimental thinking. These experiences help students—particularly those without prior research access—develop technical confidence and envision pathways into graduate study and engineering careers.

I also use student-led project demonstrations and public showcases as outreach tools, enabling broader audiences to engage with engineering research through tangible, interactive systems. By highlighting student work in robotics and automation, I aim to demystify advanced engineering concepts and make them accessible to diverse communities.

## Commitment to Inclusive Engineering Education

My commitment to outreach is informed by my own educational journey and by my experience mentoring students from varied cultural, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds. I strive to create learning and outreach environments where students feel welcomed, supported, and empowered to pursue engineering. These values guide my teaching, research mentoring, and service activities and align closely with the broader mission of engineering education at Purdue University.
