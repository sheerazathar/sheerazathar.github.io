## K–12 and Community Outreach

I am committed to broadening participation in engineering and helping students from
underrepresented communities engage with robotics and STEM at an early stage.  
At Purdue University, I have been actively involved in several outreach activities:

- **Lab tours and hands-on demonstrations**  
  Organized visits to the MARS Lab for middle- and high-school students from
  Indianapolis, IN and Kettering, OH. Activities included robot demos,
  simple perception experiments, and discussions on pathways into engineering.

- **Purdue FIRST Programs**  
  Supported \[Purdue FIRST Programs](https://www.purduefirst.org/) by
  giving lab tours and Q&A sessions for FRC and FTC teams, highlighting how
  concepts from competition robots connect to university-level research.

## Minority Engineering & Pre-College Programs

I work closely with initiatives aimed at students from multi-ethnic and
first-generation backgrounds:

- **Minority Engineering Program (MEP)**  
  Participated in outreach events organized by the  
  \[Minority Engineering Program (MEP)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MEP),
  sharing my experience as an international/first-generation researcher and
  discussing research opportunities in robotics and tactile sensing.

- **Multi-Ethnic Introduction to Engineering (MITE)**  
  Delivered lab demonstrations and informal talks for students in the MITE
  summer program, introducing them to soft robotics, tactile sensing, and
  autonomous systems.

- **Pre-Freshman and Cooperative Education (PREFACE)**  
  Contributed to activities for PREFACE participants, focusing on how
  fundamental physics and mathematics appear in robot design, sensing, and
  control.

## Student Clubs and Mentoring

- **Autonomous Robotics Club (ARC), Purdue**  
  Served as an advisor for the \[Autonomous Robotics Club (ARC)](https://purduearc.com/),
  providing guidance on perception, manipulation, and system integration.
  Helped student teams connect their competition projects with research-level
  topics such as multimodal sensing and embodied intelligence.

- **Individual mentoring**  
  Mentored undergraduate and master’s students from diverse backgrounds on
  research projects in tactile sensing, soft robotics, and underwater
  systems, with an emphasis on inclusive, hands-on learning and long-term
  growth.
