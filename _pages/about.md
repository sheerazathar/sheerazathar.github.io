Hi! I’m Sheeraz, a PhD candidate in Industrial Engineering at Purdue University. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Yu She](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=256650) at the [MARS Lab](https://www.purduemars.com/). My research focuses on robotics, embodied sensing, and intelligent physical interaction, with an emphasis on building and experimentally validating real robotic systems.

Prior to Purdue, I completed my M.Phil. at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/home), where I was affiliated with the [Cheng Kar-Shun Robotics Institute](https://ri.ust.hk/home). My master’s thesis concentration was robotics, and I received extensive training in robot manipulation, robot perception, and learning-based methods. Before joining HKUST, I completed my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at [Aligarh Muslim University](https://www.amu.ac.in/), India.

I am currently applying for **faculty and postdoctoral positions** in robotics, mechanical engineering, and industrial/engineering systems, with a long-term goal of building research programs that integrate sensing, mechanics, and learning for intelligent robotic interaction.

## My work and research

I use engineering, mathematical, and computational tools to design and study **soft, compliant, and bio-inspired robotic systems**, with a particular emphasis on multimodal sensing and physical interaction. My research is inherently interdisciplinary and intersects robotics, biomechanics, materials and manufacturing, and learning-enabled perception.

As robots become increasingly integrated into human-centered environments—such as manufacturing, healthcare, and assistive systems—robust and safe physical interaction becomes critical. My work explores how compliant mechanisms, tactile and multimodal sensing, and learning-based inference can be co-designed to enable robots to perceive contact, adapt to uncertainty, and operate reliably in real-world settings. 

More broadly, I am interested in **embodied intelligence**, where sensing, mechanics, and control are treated as a unified system rather than independent components. Through this research direction, I aim to contribute robotic systems that are not only technically capable, but also interpretable, robust, and suitable for deployment beyond controlled laboratory environments.

This website serves as a platform to share my research, teaching, and outreach activities. If you would like to discuss related topics, potential collaborations, or student mentorship opportunities, please feel free to reach out.
